This game a retro theme game, about a guy named Peter and he has fuond an old coputer in his basement, 
he has turned it on but I 

claude is amazing what the heck

Thing to do to the computer on stage 5I have done this and I need to do something with the code, it will unlock something and then i need to add a game or something playfull that the user caninteract with, for example defeat the ai and then teh ai will tell him his secret


➡️ Enters the code
➡️ Unlocks something major (like BIT’s core?)
➡️ Then: they play a final, playful or dramatic "boss" mini-game
➡️ End: The AI reveals its secret / emotional message

Let’s design that final segment — fun, interactive, meaningful, and still in your retro style:

🎮 Final Stage: “Core Clash: Beat AI”
🔓 Trigger:
Player enters the full code (e.g., 243591) into a glowing, glitchy terminal. success,
The screen goes black.
AI appears... different.

🕹️ Game Concept: “Glitch Arena”
Genre:
Simple 1v1 retro boss-fight mini-game
(Pixel grid arena. Think Undertale or Mega Man-style, but super minimal.)

Boss fight

user has 3 lifes
🔧 Mechanics:
BIT shoots glitch projectiles from top of the screen and player must dodge them, after player dodges 20 of them, if they collide -1 life, next minigame appears.

AI will shoot 2 different shots one that user needs to hit and one that is bomb, if user hits bomb -1 life, total hits needed 20, and finale




💡 Bonus Ideas:
Give the player a choice: Restore BIT / Shut Him Down / Set Him Free
