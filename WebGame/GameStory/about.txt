üî∑ Revised Story Premise
You play as a curious kid who discovers an old, dusty retro computer in the attic. It boots into a strange, forgotten operating system called "EchoOS". This computer used to belong to their mom when she was a child, and it holds memories, secrets, and locked-away pieces of her past.

To uncover what‚Äôs hidden and why the machine was forgotten, the player must complete 6 ‚Äúmemory stages‚Äù, each one styled like a classic game but themed around a memory, puzzle, or emotional beat.

üî∑ Story Flow (By Stage)
Stage 1 ‚Äì The Search (Google-style interface)
The player uses a fake retro ‚ÄúEchoNet‚Äù search bar to look up a term found in a notebook or clue.

They search for ‚ÄúMom‚Äôs Secret Project‚Äù or ‚ÄúVault Code.‚Äù

Hidden in the search results is a clue/code that unlocks the next phase.

Theme: Curiosity / Discovery
Mechanic: Searching, clicking links, decoding fake websites.

Stage 2 ‚Äì The Lock (Computer Interface)
The player enters a password/code into Mom‚Äôs old computer account.

This unlocks access to her childhood files, revealing a game launcher called ‚ÄúEcho Games.‚Äù

Theme: Secrets / Access
Mechanic: Password input, file exploration, simple puzzles.

Stage 3 ‚Äì Snake Game Challenge
The player must beat a certain score in a Snake mini-game.

This game was one of Mom‚Äôs favorites and a gateway to deeper parts of the system.

Theme: Fun / Nostalgia
Mechanic: Classic Snake, retro vibe, increasingly harder.

Stage 4 ‚Äì The Climb (Jump King-style Level)
Platforming challenge where the player climbs a pixel-tower of memories to reach a glowing key.

Theme: Effort / Growth
Mechanic: Precision platforming, frustration, reward (key).

Stage 5 ‚Äì The Chest (Treasure Room)
Using the key from the climb, the player opens a locked chest in the attic, revealing an old disk drive labeled "Project ECHO."

Theme: Discovery / Sentiment
Mechanic: Interaction, opening the chest, triggering next story beat.

Stage 6 ‚Äì Final Memory / Message
The disk is inserted into the old computer.

It launches a pixel-animated scene or cutscene showing Mom as a kid creating ‚ÄúEchoOS‚Äù as a dream project.

She leaves a message: ‚ÄúIf you found this, then maybe you‚Äôre ready to keep dreaming too.‚Äù

Ending could offer a choice to continue exploring or shut down the system.

Theme: Legacy / Passing the Torch
Mechanic: Narrative, animated scene, soft emotional ending.

üî∑ Final Notes
Keep the games: All the gameplay types you already built (search bar, Snake, Jump King, chest unlock) work great.

Wrap them in a story about curiosity, nostalgia, and generational memory.

Optional: Include a light mystery or emotional core (e.g., Mom gave up her dream, and now the player can finish what she started).

Would you like help with:

Dialogue ideas for the character/narrator?

In-game text and memory files?

Title screen concept?

Code-based implementation for transitions or scenes?

Let me know what part you‚Äôre focusing on next!
